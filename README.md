# django-oauth2-provider

OAuth2 provider for your Django applications. Comes with a default OAuth2
backend that uses whatever DB you've configured for Django.

You can override the default behaviour by subclassing views and adding your
own authentication backends and forms.

So far, look at `provider.oauth2` - More will follow shortly...
